# hyperfine_spin_qubits
Basic module for simulation of 1/2 spin qubits with hyperfine interaction

This is the code from the 2012 MPhys project simulating an array of spin half qubits. This file includes hard coded physical parameters for the hyperfine interaction of an electron in a lattice nearby silicon-28 atoms. There are is also the option for including an external magnetic field.

The code is a little obsfucated as it is all in one file, at the time this was due to the nature of the work, but it could be easily broken up and recoded.

The simulation can either use a numerical or absolute solution which can be altered in the program itself.
